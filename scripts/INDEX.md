## Release Read Paths

| Task | First file | One direct dependency | Focused test | Implementation lines |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Change release flags or phase order | `release.mjs` | `release-config.mjs` | `release.test.mjs` | under 400 |
| Change version/changelog behavior | `release-version.mjs` | `release-config.mjs` | `release.test.mjs` | under 300 |
| Diagnose push/tag/Release retry | `release-git.mjs` or `release-github.mjs` | `release-config.mjs` | `release.test.mjs` | under 350 |

The release CLI does not store credentials or persistent state. It derives resume state from Git tags, commits, and GitHub Release records.
